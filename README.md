# Checkers-Game-

Checkers is also known as [draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts). Checkers was developed from [alquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque) around the start of the 12th century. The term checkers derives from the [checkerboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard) which the game is played on, whereas draughts derives from the verb to draw or to move.

Checkers is known as a more accessible alternative to chess. It is a traditional board game made of 64 dark and light squares, with 24 black and white game pieces which are played between two people. The player with darker pieces will go first to start the game. All of the pieces must stay on the darker squares of the board. All pieces must be captured in order to win.
