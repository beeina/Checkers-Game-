Checkers Game - Project 1


Checkers 

Checkers is also known as draughts. Checkers was developed from alquerque, a game originating in the Middle East around the start of the 12th century. The term checkers derives from the checkerboard which the game is played on, whereas draughts derives from the verb to draw or to move.

Checkers is known as a more accessible alternative to chess. It is a traditional board game made of 64 dark and light squares, with 24 black and white game pieces which are played between two people. The player with darker pieces will go first to start the game. All of the pieces must stay on the darker squares of the board. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. The goal is to capture all the opponent’s pieces by jumping over them. When one of the pieces reaches the opponent’s end of the board, it can be crowned a king and move both forward as well backward. All pieces must be captured in order to win.
